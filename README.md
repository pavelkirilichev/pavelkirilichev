I'm full-stack developer and a freelance software engineer!
<br />
<br />
My passion for programming has been born since high school. I got into a class where they taught coding and I was the worst there, so I wanted to understand what is in this programming that is beyond my control. From that day on, I discovered a new world, developing complex algorithms and cool interfaces
